# AmigaSchematics
Schematics of various Commodore Amiga related items

# Overview

This project contains some schematics that I've reproduced from
various sources that are otherwise not available. They have been
made using KiCad 4.0.7 on my Mac, although they should load in KiCad
4 on any platform.

The projects included here are:

* (A500_kyb_Mitsumi)[A500_kyb_Mitsumi) - Amiga 500 keyboard with Mitsumi board. (common)

Soon perhaps:
* (A500_kyb_2Conn)[A500_kyb_2Conn] - Early Amiga 500 keyboard with two ribbon connectors to the scan matrix



# Note

I'm pretty green with respect to KiCad, so if there are any things 
in here that I did poorly or in a weird way, that's probably the 
reason. I am always open to comments and suggestions for improving
my abilities, so please feel free to contribute constructive 
criticism.  :)
