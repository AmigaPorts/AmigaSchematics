# Amiga 500 2-connector Keyboard Interface

![Board](A500_kyb_2conn_board.png)

This captures the early interface for the Amiga 500 keyboard.

This one cane be differentiated by it having two edge connectors 
for the scan matrix.

This is currently incomplete.


# Note

I'm pretty green with respect to KiCad, so if there are any things
in here that I did poorly or in a weird way, that's probably the
reason. I am always open to comments and suggestions for improving
my abilities, so please feel free to contribute constructive
criticism.  :)

And of course, I'm always open for corrections and discrepancies
with resect to what you've found in actual hardware.
