# Amiga 500 Mitsumi Keyboard Interface

![Board](A500_kyb_Mitsumi_board.png)

This captures the Mitsumi branded interface for the Amiga 500
keyboard.  This one cane be differentiated by it having a single 
31-pin edge connector, as well as "Mitsumi" printed on the board.

The original capture that this is based on was labelled "MITSUMI,
MTM-4V-0, PCB A-500, 56 A620A", and was captured by user "nocash"
in [this thread](http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=81893). The
relevant text has been [copied into this
repo](Reference/A5kyb_nocash_schem.txt) as well.

The current schematic is also available in this directory in pdf and 
png format.

# Note

I'm pretty green with respect to KiCad, so if there are any things
in here that I did poorly or in a weird way, that's probably the
reason. I am always open to comments and suggestions for improving
my abilities, so please feel free to contribute constructive
criticism.  :)

And of course, I'm always open for corrections and discrepancies
with resect to what you've found in actual hardware.
